My mind takes me to speak of forms changed
into new bodies. O gods
breathe upon my undertakings (for you have changed them also) and from the first origin of the world
to my times, bring down perpetual song!
Before the sea and the lands and (which covers all things) the sky,
one form was in the whole sphere of nature,
which they called Chaos, a raw undigested mass,
and nothing but an inert mass, and heaped up in the same [place],
the discordant seeds of things not well joined
